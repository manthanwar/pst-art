## Introduction

This package and its user manual are available at [ctan archive](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/pst-flags).

### About pst-flags

This package provides a number of macros for rendering flags of world countries and their associated artefacts drawn using LaTeX PSTricks package that allow the inclusion of PostScript drawings directly inside TeX or LaTeX source code. This package further contributes towards a complete implementation of the vector drawing capabilities provided by PSTricks. Formatting of the resulting drawings is entirely controlled by the TeX macros. A good working knowledge of LaTeX should be sufficient to design flags of sovereign countries and adapt them to create new designs. Features such as color or shape customisation and dynamic modifications are possible by cleverly adjusting the options supplied to the TeX macros.

## Installation and usage of **pst-flags**

### Installation

As prerequisites for *pst-flags*, you need working
versions of LaTeX and *pstricks*. The style file `pst-flags.sty` and all corresponding **.tex** and **.eps** assets must be somewhere in your TeX-input path, where *dvips* can find it. Download the zip file from the \texttt{pst-flags} [project page on GitHub](ttps://github.com/manthanwar/pst-flags) and unzip it in the same location as your tex file. Try to complile using the classic `latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf` toolchain.

### Dependencies

### Usage

Load the packages **pstricks** and **pst-flags**
in that order via the `\usepackage` macro. Now you are ready to use the `\usepackage{pst-flags}` macros within your document body. This macro is described in the next section with all its options. With the help of the following simple LaTeX-source code you can test whether you have correctly installed the package:

```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pst-flags}
\begin{document}
Flag of US: \rput(0,0){\flagUS[2]}
\end{document}
```

```
\usepackage{pst-flags-colors-html}
\pscircle[linecolor=usRed](0,0){2}
