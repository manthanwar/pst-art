# Contributing to this repository

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small!

## Getting started

Before you begin:

- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check if we [accept contributions](#types-of-contributions-memo) for your type
  of contribution.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
  will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to
  [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)
  so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until
  you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace)
  using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without
  having to install and run the project locally.

### Make your update

Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. Here are some tips and
tricks for [using the docs codebase](#working-in-the-githubdocs-repository).

- Are you contributing to markdown? We use
  [GitHub Markdown](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

### Open a Pull Request (PR)

When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use
the [pull request template](#pull-request-template) to open your PR (pull
request).

### Submit your PR and get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with
  you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a
  [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the
  conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our
  [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts)
  on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! The whole GitHub community thanks you. :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the
[contributor chart](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/graphs/contributors).

## Types of contributions :memo:

You can contribute to the content and site in several ways. This repo is a place
to discuss and collaborate on github.com! Our small, but mighty :muscle: docs
team is maintaining this repo, to preserve our bandwidth, off topic
conversations will be closed.

### :mega: Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new
idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in
[discussions](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/discussions).

### :beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)
are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a
triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated,
search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's
something new, open an issue using a
[New Issue](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/issues/new). We'll use
the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix. See the
issues at [Reported Issues](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/issues)

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A
[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24
hours. :earth_africa: To learn more about opening a pull request in this repo,
see [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request) below.

We cannot accept contributions to the
[REST API reference documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference).
If you spot an inaccuracy in the REST API reference documentation, open an issue
in the
[github/rest-api-description](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/issues/new?template=schema-inaccuracy.md)
repository.

### :question: Support

We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a
continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support
questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with GitHub,
unrelated to our documentation, please
[contact GitHub Support directly](https://support.github.com/contact). Any
issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be
given information about how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.

If you're having trouble with your GitHub account, contact
[Support](https://support.github.com/contact).

### :earth_asia: Translations

This website is internationalized and available in multiple languages. The
source content in this repository is written in English. We integrate with an
external localization platform called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) and work
with professional translators to localize the English content.

**We do not currently accept contributions for translated content**, but we hope
to in the future.

### :balance_scale: Site Policy

GitHub's site policies are published on docs.github.com, too!

If you find a typo in the site policy section, you can open a pull request to
fix it. For anything else, see
[the CONTRIBUTING guide in the site-policy repo](https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Starting with an issue

You can browse existing issues to find something that needs help!

### Labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.

- The
  [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/labels/help%20wanted)
  is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The
  [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
- [`bugs` label](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/labels/bug) is for
  problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The
  [`documentation` label](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/labels/documentation)
  is for helping improve the documentation.
- The
  [`content` label](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/labels/content)
  is for problems or updates in the content on README.md. These will usually
  require some knowledge of Markdown.
- The
  [`engineering` label](https://github.com/manthanwar/pst-art/labels/engineering)
  is for problems or updates in the source codes. These will usually require
  some knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js or YAML to fix.

## Opening a pull request

You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like
fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it
locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Working in the github/docs repository

Here's some information that might be helpful while working on a Docs PR:

- [Development](/contributing/development.md) - This short guide describes how
  to get this app running on your local machine.

- [Content markup reference](/contributing/content-markup-reference.md) - All of
  our content is written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, with some additional
  enhancements.

- [Content style guide for GitHub Docs](/contributing/content-style-guide.md) -
  This guide covers GitHub-specific information about how we style our content
  and images. It also links to the resources we use for general style
  guidelines.

- [Content model](/contributing/content-model.md) and
  [content templates](/contributing/content-templates.md) - The content model
  describes the purpose of each type of content we use in GitHub Docs and how to
  write for each type. The templates allow you to quickly get started with new
  articles.

- [Reusables](/data/reusables/README.md) - We use reusables to help us keep
  content up to date. Instead of writing the same long string of information in
  several articles, we create a reusable, then call it from the individual
  articles.

- [Variables](/data/variables/README.md) - We use variables the same way we use
  reusables. Variables are for short strings of reusable text.

- [Liquid](/contributing/liquid-helpers.md) - We use liquid helpers to create
  different versions of our content.

- [Scripts](/script/README.md) - The scripts directory is the home for all of
  the scripts you can run locally.

- [Tests](/tests/README.md) - We use tests to ensure content will render
  correctly on the site. Tests run automatically in your PR, and sometimes it's
  also helpful to run them locally.

## Reviewing

We (usually the docs team, but sometimes GitHub product managers, engineers, or
supportocats too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create
the best content we can for people who use GitHub.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did
the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time. :yellow_heart:
Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it. :yellow_heart: Reviews
are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in
      the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the
      output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected.
      This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style
      guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems.
      Remember that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Review the entire pull request using the
      [localization checklist](contributing/localization-checklist.md).
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the
      [style guide](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/content-style-guide.md).
- [ ] Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is
      correct.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until
      they're all passing.

### Pull request template

When you open a pull request, you must fill out the "Ready for review" template
before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your
changes and the purpose of your pull request.

### Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using
[suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the
UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your
branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
[resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to
be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix based
   systems use `\n`. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n`
   instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js
   [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to
   get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
1. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be
   returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`,
   `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you
   need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works
   with either.
1. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so
   it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of
   Bash.

## Editor setup

If you use VS Code you can modify the contents of `.vscode/settings.json` to
make it use the JSON Schema definitions. Other editors have different options to
load JSON Schema files.

## Debugging code

A common approach to debugging JavaScript code is to walk through the code using the [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) debugger.
